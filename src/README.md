Description

This repository contains the frontend of an internal learning platform designed for organizations or teams that want to foster continuous learning and knowledge sharing among employees.
Unlike public platforms such as Coursera or Udemy, this system is intended for internal use, where employees can create and share short, skill-based learning materials — such as courses or tutorial videos — with their colleagues. The frontend is built using React and communicates with a Django REST API on the backend. It handles user interaction, course management, profile editing, and data fetching using authenticated API requests.
